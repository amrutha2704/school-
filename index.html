<p>Academics
    hpad_acdms2Affiliated to the CBSE, New Delhi (CBSE Affiliation: CBSE/Aff./EX-01095-0910/130190/2009/192267, dated 19/08/2009, Provisional affiliation), we follow a system of continuous evaluation that covers both the scholastic and non-scholastic aspects of student’s growth.  We have classes from 1 to X.
    
    Our curriculum adds qualitative content beyond the prescribed syllabus; maximises students’ progress in intellectual, spiritual, emotional, physical, cultural and artistic fields; emphasizes activity-based and experiential learning and focuses on self-exploration and learning through co-scholastic activities and frequent educational outings.  Ours is a consciously and thoughtfully designed all-inclusive curriculum.
    
    We seek to develop in our students the ability to think beyond the boundaries of the classroom walls, the text in the books and the exam marks.  In fact the objective is to shape a child’s mind to learn not just for the grade he is in, but to learn for life.
    
    Right from the start to the senior secondary level, the goal is to promote need based learning of not just the standard subjects but also life skills like value education, fitness, etiquette and team work.
    
    Evaluation is based on comprehensive assessment of performance throughout the year.  The various fields are class response, lab activity and project work, participation in cultural activities, personality, response and sensitivity to environmental and social issues.
